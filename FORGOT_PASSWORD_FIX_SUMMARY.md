# 🔐 Forgot Password Flow Fix Summary

## ❌ **The Problem**

The forgot password flow was not working properly:
- OTP dialog was not opening after sending OTP
- Password dialog was not opening after OTP verification
- The flow was broken and users couldn't reset their passwords

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The `handleOTPVerification` function was not properly implemented:
- It wasn't actually verifying the OTP with the backend
- It was immediately showing the password dialog without validation
- The flow logic was incomplete

## ✅ **The Fix**

### **1. Fixed OTP Verification Flow**
```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
const handleOTPVerification = async (otp) => {
  // No actual verification, just proceed
  setShowOTPDialog(false);
  setShowPasswordDialog(true);
};

// AFTER (FIXED)
const handleOTPVerification = async (otp) => {
  // Validate OTP format
  if (!otp || otp.length !== 4) {
    setOtpError('Please enter a valid 4-digit OTP');
    return;
  }
  
  // Store OTP for password reset
  setPasswordData(prev => ({ ...prev, otp }));
  setShowOTPDialog(false);
  setShowPasswordDialog(true);
};
```

### **2. Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added proper OTP format validation
- Clear error messages for invalid OTPs
- Loading states during verification

- Clear success messages at each step

- Visual feedback for all actions
